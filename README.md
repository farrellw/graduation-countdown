# Graduation Countdown
Countdown application, done as a favor to countdown the days until Brown School graduates at Washington University in St. Louis. Allows for students to post motivation messages, which persist and then can be displayed at random.

## Software
React and Express.  Makes use of design pattern flux. Project is connected to a postgres database, allowing persistance. (Postgres instead of MongoDB because heroku allows free Postgres plans).

## Hosted
On heroku at https://graduation-countdown.herokuapp.com/

## Running the program
### Server
` npm run start `

### client
` cd react-ui`
` npm run start`
